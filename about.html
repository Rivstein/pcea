        <p>PCEA Nyahururu was originally known as Thomson’s Falls. The first PCEA Nyahururu Congregation started worshipping at a small roofed timber house next to the Starehe social hall, after the late senior Chief Julius Mwema requested Nyahururu Town Council to allow the church to use the hall. Later, the late Clement Kiarie Gachie who was a civil servant gave the congregation another site at Soil Conservation quarters where two other denominations were worshipping. On Sundays arrangements were made for PCEA members to worship first, followed by Anglicans and the Pentecost Church members. PCEA members then approached the Town Council to be allocated a plot to build their own Church hence acquiring the land where the PCEA Nyahururu church now stands. In 1956 the Parish Session met and organized the construction of the old church. The Parish minister by then was Rev. Ismael Kagunyi. It was a very trying moment as it was the time the state of emergency had been declared by the colonial Government.</p>

    <p>The Church was estimated to cost about Kshs. 14,000.00 at completion.Old Church People were devoted and committed and they donated willingly. Some people were fully dedicated to church hence making great sacrifices; for instance Ngugiwa Njoroge made a sacrifice by selling his bicycle and forwarding the proceeds of the sale to the construction of the church. In 1956, the foundation stone was laid by Rt. Rev.R. Macpherson the then Moderator of the General Assembly. After the state of emergency the number of members increased significantly. In early 1970s, during the tenure of Rev. Eliseus Iguna, a shed was built to cater for members space but with time it was not enough. The minister’s house was built between 1973-1976 and the hall between 1975-1978.</p>
        <p> In 1988 during the tenure of Rev. Samuel Theuri, the idea of constructing a bigger Church was conceived and all the necessary arrangements made. At that time the building was expected to cost between Kshs. 4 and 6 million. The Chairman and secretary of the construction committee were the late A.M. Ndoro and Isaac K. Wanganju respectively. The construction was successful but the cost shot to 12.5m due to inflation The ground breaking for the current church was done by Rev. Charles W. Kimburi on 12th April, 1993 while the foundation stone laid on 28th May 1995 by the Late Rev.David Muiruri the then Moderator of Laikipia Presbytery. The rededication was done on 9th January 2005 by Rt. Rev.Dr.David M. Githii, Moderator of the 18th General Assembly.</p>

      <h2>Our Faith</h2>
      <div>As a Parish we operate under the Presbyterian tenets of reformed faith in which we are part of the Universal Church of Jesus Christ. We subscribe to the worship of the God Almighty, the all-wise and all-loving, in the Trinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, the same in substance, equal in power and glory, adoring the Father, infinite in majesty, of whom and for whom are all things. We confess our Lord Jesus Christ, the Eternal Son, made very man for our salvation, glorying in His cross and His resurrection and owing obedience to Him as the head over all things in His church. We trust in the promised renewal and guidance of the Holy Spirit. We proclaim the forgiveness of sins and acceptance by God through faith in Christ and the gift of eternal life. We labor for the advancement of the Kingdom of God throughout the world. We believe in the inerrancy of scriptures and the word of God as contained in both Old and New Testaments, as the supreme rule of faith. We avow the fundamental doctrines of Catholic faith founded upon the word of God and its interpretation and teaching adhering to the guiding principles of the Protestant Reformation.</div>
